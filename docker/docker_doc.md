## run
docker run -p 8000:8000 --name inference_container inference:latest

docker run	Start a new container based on an image
-p 8000:8000	Map port 8000 on your host â†’ port 8000 in the container

Start the container named inference_container

Map port 8000 of the container to port 8000 on your host

Access your API at http://localhost:8000

Additional tips:
